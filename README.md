# Django-Projects
This repo includes django projects that I create while learning
<br>
<br>
<p>1. Task Project is a basic crud project created using django. It has one app call crud. I cretaed this by watching a you tube tutorial.</p>
<br><br>
<p>2. resume uploader is a basic project in which one can upload a resume only in pdf format. And can also view the resume. 
It has one app called Resume.
<br>
This project is still in process. I have to create registration form, login form and then I want to display the files uploaded by each user. Each user will be given an option to see his files. There will be a link on each of his files. I also want to give the download option to the user.</p>
