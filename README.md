# Django-Projects
This repo includes django projects that I create while learning
<br>
<br>
<p>1. Task Project is a basic crud project created using django. It has one app call crud. I cretaed this by watching a you tube tutorial.</p>
<br><br>
<p>2. resume uploader is a basic project in which one can upload a resume only in pdf format. And can also view and download the resume. 
It has one app called upload.
<br>
This project is still in process. I have to create registration form, login form and then I want to display the files uploaded by each user. Only admin can see all the user's name and when he clicks on particular user he can see all the files of each user.
User can only see his own files. There will be a link on each of his files so that he can view the file. I also want to give the download option to the user.</p>
